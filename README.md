# WuPulse

A [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) project designed to marry Wufoo and DaPulse together with the use of [PhpPulse](https://github.com/allejo/PhpPulse).

Why build this when services like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) exist? Well, Zapier falls embarrassingly short of any decent DaPulse support. This project was made for CSUN's Associated Students to create endpoints that Wufoo can send requests to and then the data will be submitted to DaPulse. You have **full control** of how the data looks and what data to use.

This project has everything hard coded but I do intend on making this more robust so everything can be configured through a configuration file and it can be used freely by anyone. For now, this would serve as a good starting point.
